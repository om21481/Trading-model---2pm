# Trading-model---3pm
DATA is used of NSE:NIFTY 50 only  (widely used Indian Index)
Firstly, I have made some data rows according to direction and agressiveness of momentum that is indicated in the market. It is basically based on famous 3pm setup in markets.


Why 3pm setup -- This is major time where option/futures buyers and sellers are exiting their positions and making new positions for upcoming days, which results in major moves and market inefficiencies.
